I want to do a coding style and clean code refactor. We prefer to have helper methods such that the main logic consists of a couple of clear steps. We prefer readability over compactnes, but at the same time, when files get large, this means there is a need for a separate service with a specific topic/goal/subject. Also think of logical file structures and file names. We highly appreciate all guidelines from Clean Code by Robert C Marin Uncle Bob.
